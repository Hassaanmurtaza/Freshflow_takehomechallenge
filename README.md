# Freshflow_takehomechallenge

## Overview
This solution uses a basic flash api with just one GET method to retrive all the dicts as a list using sqlite3 to query according to the outlined requirements.
Pandas is used to read the query and save to dataframe, then convert the dataframe to a json dictionary

The GET can be viewed through the localhost link prompt which will be displayed on the console after the file is run using python.
